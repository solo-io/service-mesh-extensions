  Functionality
  Service Mesh Playground

  Multi-mesh Performance Benchmark
  Meshery is intended to be a vendor and project-neutral utility for uniformly benchmarking the performance of service meshes. Between service mesh and proxy projects (and surprisingly, within a single project), a number of different tools and results exist.

  Multi-mesh Functionalty Playground
  A service mesh playground to faciliate learning about functionality of different service meshes. Meshery incorporates a visual interface for manipulating traffic routing rules. Sample applications will be included in Meshery.
